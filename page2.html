      I want to see Maine with its New England styles, beautiful salted lighthouses, and
      Acadia National Park - every photo of it reminds me of an Autumn paradise. I want to
      dip my feet into its tidepools, hike among its firs and pines, and take in the crisp
      salty air of its promontories.

    <p>
      Crater Lake is a deep volcanic well with crystal clear waters and an island of wizards in
      its center. I want to feel the resounding heartbeat of the caldera as I peer into its endless
      depths.

      Playing the video game Fallout: New Vegas I've always wanted to venture to this place to see
      all the locations I visited in my playthrough. Not only do the photos give a sense of grandeur
      but there is a deep feeling of nostalgia that comes with each capture of the canyons, rivers,
      and orange shrub-filled paths.
